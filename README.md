Pokemon Memory Game is a Heroku hosted memory game. It utilizes React.js to render the page. Once the virtual DOM is rendered it includes 12 images that are randomized each time a card is clicked. To begin the game simply click on any image. Be careful to remember what you clicked! Clicking an image twice will reset the game! Have fun!
